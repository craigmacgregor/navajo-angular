            <p class="font-grey-dark italic">Everything you need to know</p>

            <p>We are very glad to announce that Nav Coin 2.0 is up and running! An automated coin swap was performed through Bittrex on <strong>31 May 2016</strong>.</p>

            <p>The old blockchain and automated coin swap wallet has now been taken offline.</p>

            <p>All legitimate Nav Coin users will be able to participate in the coin swap at any time simply by <a href="mailto:admin@navcoin.org" target="e">contacting the development team</a>.</p>
            <p>A simple way to tell if you need to upgrade is to look at your wallet address. If your wallet address starts with "N", there is no need to upgrade, you are already on the new blockchain. If your wallet address begins with another letter, please read the steps below on how to upgrade your coins.</p>

            <h4 class="font-grape" style="margin: 20px 0;">Swap Details</h4>

            <p>All coins are be swapped at a value of 1:1 and there are the same total number of NAV on the new and old block chains.</p>
            <p>All parameters of the new block chain (staking amount, block time etc) remain the same as the old chain.</p>

            <p>Check out the long list of improvements which are made possible by the new code base!</p>

              <h4>BIP 14 - Protocol Version and User Agent</h4>

              <p>Bitcoin user agents are a modified browser user agent with more structure to aid parsers and provide some coherence. In bitcoin, the software usually works like a stack starting from the core code-base up to the end graphical interface. Therefore the user agent strings codify this relationship.</p>

              <h4>BIP 21 - URI Scheme</h4>

              <p>This BIP proposes a URI scheme for making Bitcoin payments. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or scanning QR Codes.</p>

              <p>This BIP describes a new JSON-RPC method for "smart" Bitcoin miners and proxies. Instead of sending a simple block header for hashing, the entire block structure is sent, and left to the miner to (optionally) customize and assemble.</p>

              <h4>BIP 32 - Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</h4>

              <p>Capability to generate wallet addresses from a single private seed. This allows the user to re-generate key pairs from the seed if the wallet is lost. Backup frequency is reduced. Wallet generation methods are now compliant with web & mobile wallet standards.</p>

              <h4>BIP 44 - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets</h4>

              <p>This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on an algorithm described in BIP 32. The hierarchy proposed in this paper is quite comprehensive. It allows the handling of multiple coins, multiple accounts, external and internal chains per account and millions of addresses per chain.</p>

              <p>Provides changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules in order to make malleability of transactions impossible (at least when the sender doesn't choose to avoid it).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="upgrade-feature-block">

              <p>Maximum block size is increased to 20MB with the maximum size for mined blocks set to 10MB. Block size is dynamic and changes in response to the volume of transactions. This future proofs the coin to be capable of handling all perceived future transaction volumes.</p>

            <div class="upgrade-feature-block">
              <p>With the new wallet deployed it means that we will now be able to finish off and release some of the work on our projects page which was previously blocked by the fact we werenâ€™t able to use remote block chains and performance issues. This includes:</p>

                <h4>Mobile NAV Coin Wallet</h4>
                <p>As explained, we will now be able to deploy a mobile NAV wallet for both Android and IOS. Users to have a fully qualified wallet with the coins stored on your device. When we release our mobile wallet we will in a very small club of Proof of Stake coins with a mobile wallet. Then with phase 2 of the mobile wallet the NAV Coin dev team will unlocked a massive milestone; Worldâ€™s first anonymous cryptocurrency transaction using a mobile phone!</p>

                <p>Similar to the Mobile wallet, this allows us to build a fully qualified wallet that you can use through your web browser. You could then either run the code from your computer and / or we could integrate it into the NAV website for you to use.</p>

                <p>With the performance increases achieved by implementing all the BIPâ€™s weâ€™ve integrated by rebasing NAV Coin will allow us to successfully run the Raspberry Pi staking units. This is going to be a great system you can use to mine NAV very cheaply. Initially it will be a deployment which you run on your own Raspberry Pi and subsequently optionally purchasing a touch screen version from us.</p>

Once we have the coin swap sorted I will port all the work I have done previously to the new wallet and then resume working on the decentralisation project. It will only be a minor step sideways for the project, i will not have to discard my work and start over. I will update you on this projectâ€™s status and timeline on the other side of the coin swap. </p>
