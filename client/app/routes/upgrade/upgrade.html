            <p>
                Myself and the NAV team feel very strongly about helping  Kimochi and the Navajo tribe. We think it’s important to support indigenous people to live on their land, and to assist and show respect for the tribal elders who face freezing winters with no electricity or running water.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re really happy that the NAV coin has been chosen and the currency for Kimochi donations. It’s one of the most practical and direct charities we have come across, with vey intelligent ideas and education behind it. We look forward to seeing our trading volumes rise as people gives generously to this worthy cause.

            <h3>About Charles Cambridge</h3>

            <p>
                Charles Cambridge is a Navajo archeologist and doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He runs a non profit organization called Kimochi, that has helped tribal peoples all around the world.
            </p>

            <h3>About Kimochi</h3>

            <p>
                Kimochi, Inc. is an established nonprofit and tax-exempt human relations and a service group that has, since its inception in 1972, conducted its business in good standing under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Having incorporated in 1972 and reincorporate under the legal authority of the Colorado Nonprofit Corporation Act, the group has maintained its primary base in its founding birthplace of Boulder, Colorado.  The American Indian and Asian American students of the University of Colorado, created Kimochi.  Kimochi was established in the spring of 1972 to provide services and education to their communities in Colorado.  This was a step from the academic setting of the university to help elders and other community members.  The name, Kimochi, is a Japanese word meaning "a feeling of good will."  The current officers of Kimochi are President: Charles Cambridge, Boulder, Colorado and Vice President, Board member and Secretary: Elaine Takahashi, Los Angeles, California.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kimochi operated programs only if funding and volunteers were available.  This created a unique personal style with a low profile approach.  Kimochi started projects through "simple" levels of technical assistance.  Kimochi undertakes projects generally overlooked or avoided by other organizations.  Volunteers and the membership of Kimochi have funded most of following projects.

            <h3>What they've done</h3>

            <p>
                Kimochi’s Christmas Project in cooperation with other organizations in Los Angeles and Denver, gathered Christmas presents for Indian children on the Sioux and Navajo reservations.  Volunteers gathered food and turkeys for Christmas dinners.  The Traditional Medicine Support provided resources for traditional Indian medicine men and women on the Sioux reservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Kimochi Tibetan Program helped in the resettlement of Tibetan refugees in the Los Angeles area.  The Native American Business Development Initiative was to develop a for-profit woodworking and bronze casting production and marketing enterprise.  Kinematic of New York City provided funding.  The Moqui Project was an agricultural assistance project on the Hopi Reservation
            </p>
            <p>
                Kimochi’s signature programs have been its summer volunteer workcamps.  For thirty-five years, Kimochi cooperated with Service Civil International (SCI),  an international volunteer organization, to developed summer volunteer programs in Hawaii, Belize, Canada and the United States.  For the most part, the volunteer programs helped Indian elders, single parents and medicine people.  Many different sources provided funding such as the Coors Foundation and Kinematic.  However, private donations by Kimochi members and volunteers formed  the primary funding source.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shiprock Farming Workcamp cleaned and rehabilitated old irrigation ditches on the Navaho Reservation to stimulate farming.  The Navajo Garden Workcamp built garden and planted vegetables on the Navaho Reservation.  In the northeastern part of the Navaho Indian reservation in New Mexico, the Huerfano Workcamps cooperated with tribal officials to help local Navaho families. The work was the repairing of outhouses, fences, homes, corrals and the chopping of wood.

            <p>
                The Kahiki Nui Homestead Workcamp in 2000 took place on Maui, Hawaii. The United States government returned land to the Native Hawaiians on the island of Maui.  The Native Hawaiians formed the Kahiki Nui Homestead Association to built homes on the property to create a traditional Native Hawaiian community.  The Workcamp created a Kimochi archeological group to supported the State of Hawaii - Maui archeologist and the University of California at Berkeley archaeological team.  Our jointed effort provided the necessary archaeological clearance by the Federal and State government.  This allowed for the construction of homes on the property.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hopi Workcamp was in the Kykotsmovi village at the base of the Third mesa on the Hopi Indian reservation in Arizona. The Workcamp helped a local Hopi family in restoration of a collapsed roof of a home.  The work involved the cleaning and the repairing of the home.

            <p>
                The Green Grass Workcamps helped Arvol Looking Horse, a Sioux spiritual leader on the Cheyenne River Indian reservation in South Dakota.

The work involved repairing outhouses and sweats, gathering and chopping of wood and repairing the traditional Sundance grounds.

            </p>
            <p>
                Future activities are based upon the availability of funds, but programs would follow past activities in traditional Indian communities.

            <p>

            <h3>What they want to do</h3>

            <p>
                Charles’ current priority is to help Navajo elders to repair fences and chop wood to burn during the cold winters.  Most Navajo elders do not have anyone to help them since they live in very isolated areas of the reservation.  Many of their children or grandchildren are not able to provide meaningful assistance.  Alone and without electricity or running water, many Navajo elders need help in living on their land.
            </p>

            <p>
                He’s hopes to continue working on the educational center at Huerfano, New Mexico on the Navajo reservation where large and smaller hogans need to be constructed.

            </div>

            <p>
                He also hopes to reestablish kimochi’s support of isolated mountain villages’ schools on the island of Mindoro, Philippines.  The poverty of the schools limits the education of elementary students.  Buildings need to be repaired and Filipino kids need school supplies.

            <h3>The solar hogan</h3>

            <p>
                For much of his life, Cambridge has dreamed of developing a solar Hogan to make life easier for Navajos who want to live in their old age on the reservation, which required coping with harsh weather and often no electricity or running water.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                He persisted in his pursuit of his vision until three demonstration hogans using different types of solar technology were completed on the university of Colorado campus. Cambridge arranged for George Bluehorse, a shiprock, New Mexicao Medicine man to bless the shelters.
