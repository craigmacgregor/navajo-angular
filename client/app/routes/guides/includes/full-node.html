            <h3>Nav Coin Full Node Setup</h3>
            <p>
              The Nav Coin Full Node wallets are the most comprehensive Nav Coin wallets available. They store the entire block chain on your system and are not reliant on any other services to operate. If you want to send Anonymous Transactions and have your Nav Coin's earn stake rewards by participating in block mining, this is the option for you.

            <h3 class="font-grape">Choose Your Platform</h3>
            <p>
              We have a full range of options which cover Linux, Windows and OSX. You can download the full node client here: <a href="/downloads">http://navcoin.org/downloads</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're installing on Windows, we have two options available. The Windows Wallet Zip contains all the files needed to run the Nav Coin Full Node. The Windows Installer will install the Nav Coin Full Node wallet to your system and also download a recent version of the block chain to your system so you can skip boostrapping the blockchain and go directly to <a href="#AddingP2PNodes">Adding P2P Network Nodes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you've downloaded the Nav Coin Full Node wallet for your operating system, we can either attempt to sync the blockchain from the beginning through the network or we can bootstrap the blockchain to a more recent version which we provide as a download. If you want to sync the blockchain through the network skip you can skip boostrapping the blockchain and go directly to <a href="#AddingP2PNodes">Adding P2P Network Nodes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that syncing the entire blockchain through the network can take up to a few days because there is a lot of data to process. We recommend bootstrapping the blockchain where possible.

            <h3 class="font-grape">Bootstrapping the Blockchain</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the Nav Coin Blockchain Data zip from the downloads page and unzip it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Step 2.</strong> Find your NavCoin2 folder in your users %AppData% directory. The AppData folder is hidden on most operating systems, so make sure you can view hidden files.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Windows</strong> this is usually C:/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/AppData/Roaming/NavCoin2/<br />
                (replacing &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your actual computer's username)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OSX</strong> this is usually ~/Library/Application Support/NavCoin2
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Linux</strong> this is usually ~/.NavCoin2/
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If you can't find this folder, please google for where this is on your particular operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3.</strong> Inside this directory, delete all the files and folders <strong>except your wallet.dat</strong> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 4.</strong> Copy and paste the contents of the Nav Coin Blockchain Data zip into this directory.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Step 1.</strong> Find your NavCoin2 folder in your users %AppData% directory. The AppData folder is hidden on most operating systems, so make sure you can view hidden files.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Windows</strong> this is usually C:/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/AppData/Roaming/NavCoin2/
                <br />
                (replacing &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your actual computer's username)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OSX</strong> this is usually ~/Library/Application Support/NavCoin2
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Linux</strong> this is usually ~/.NavCoin2/
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2.</strong> In this directory create a plain text file called "navcoin.conf", or open this file if it already exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3.</strong> Replace the contents of this file (if any) with the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
rpcuser=&lt;USERNAME&gt;
rpcpassword=&lt;PASSWORD&gt;
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=44444
port=44440
listen=1
daemon=1
server=1
txindex=1
staking=1
maxorphanblocks=10000
addnode=185.61.148.209
addnode=95.183.51.15
addnode=95.183.50.54
addnode=5.230.142.15
addnode=5.230.146.212
addnode=95.183.53.184</pre>
            <p>
              The nodes we add here are ones which we've provided. We will add more from the public network in the following steps
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 4.</strong> Replace &lt;USERNAME&gt; and &lt;PASSWORD&gt; with your chosen username and password. These credentials are for RPC access only which is an advanced feature not accessed by most users. It's not used for encrypting your wallet, you'll need to do that seperately.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 5.</strong> Open your browser and navigate to the network page of our block explorer: <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!network">https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!network</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 6.</strong> Click the [node list] button next to the latest NavCoin subversion. This will pop up an overlay which contains a list of the latest visible network nodes in the following format:<br />
            </p>
            <pre>
addnode=1.34.180.245
addnode=101.182.34.27
addnode=104.172.24.79
etc...</pre>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 7.</strong> Copy all these lines and paste them into your "navcoin.conf" at the end of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 8.</strong> Save and close this file. Restart your Nav Coin Full Node Wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
              If in the future you find that your Wallet is having a low number of connections, replace your addnode lines in the navcoin.conf file with the latest list from the block explorer.
