            <h3>Nav Coin Full Node Setup</h3>
            <p>
              The Nav Coin Full Node wallets are the most comprehensive Nav Coin wallets available. They store the entire block chain on your system and are not reliant on any other services to operate. If you want to send Anonymous Transactions and have your Nav Coin's earn stake rewards by participating in block mining, this is the option for you.

            <h3 class="font-grape">Choose Your Platform</h3>
            <p>
              We have a full range of options which cover Linux, Windows and OSX. You can download the full node client here: <a href="/downloads">http://navcoin.org/downloads</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're installing on Windows, we have two options available. The Windows Wallet Zip contains all the files needed to run the Nav Coin Full Node. The Windows Installer will install the Nav Coin Full Node wallet to your system and also download a recent version of the block chain to your system so you can skip boostrapping the blockchain and go directly to <a href="#AddingP2PNodes">Adding P2P Network Nodes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you've downloaded the Nav Coin Full Node wallet for your operating system, we can either attempt to sync the blockchain from the beginning through the network or we can bootstrap the blockchain to a more recent version which we provide as a download. If you want to sync the blockchain through the network skip you can skip boostrapping the blockchain and go directly to <a href="#AddingP2PNodes">Adding P2P Network Nodes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that syncing the entire blockchain through the network can take up to a few days because there is a lot of data to process. We recommend bootstrapping the blockchain where possible.

            <p>
              <strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the Nav Coin Blockchain Data zip from the downloads page and unzip it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Step 2.</strong> Find your NavCoin2 folder in your users %AppData% directory.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Windows</strong> this is usually C:/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/AppData/Roaming/NavCoin2/<br />
                (replacing &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your actual computer's username)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OSX</strong> this is usually ~/.navcoin2/
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Linux</strong> this is usually ~/.navcoin2/
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If you can't find this folder, please google for where this is on your particular operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3.</strong> Inside this directory, delete all the files and folders <strong>except your wallet.dat</strong> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 4.</strong> Copy and paste the contents of the Nav Coin Blockchain Data zip into this directory.

            <p>
              <strong>Step 1.</strong> Find your NavCoin2 folder in your users %AppData% directory.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Windows</strong> this is usually C:/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/AppData/Roaming/NavCoin2/
                <br />
                (replacing &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your actual computer's username)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OSX</strong> this is usually ~/.navcoin2/
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Linux</strong> this is usually ~/.navcoin2/

            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2.</strong> In this directory create a plain text file called "navcoin.conf", or open this file if it already exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3.</strong> Add the following lines to the file:
            </p>
            <pre>
rpcuser=&lt;USERNAME&gt;
rpcpassword=&lt;PASSWORD&gt;
port=44440
listen=1
daemon=1
server=1
txindex=1
staking=1
maxconnections=12
maxorphanblocks=10000</pre>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 4.</strong> Replace &lt;USERNAME&gt; and &lt;PASSWORD&gt; with your chosen username and password. These credentials are for RPC access only which is an advanced feature not accessed by most users. It's not used for encrypting your wallet, you'll need to do that seperately.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 5.</strong> Open your browser and navigate to the network page of our block explorer: <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!network">https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!network</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 6.</strong> Click the [node list] button next to the latest NavCoin subversion. This will pop up an overlay which contains a list of the latest visible network nodes in the following format:<br />
            </p>
            <pre>
addnode=1.34.180.245
addnode=101.182.34.27
addnode=104.172.24.79
etc...</pre>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 7.</strong> Copy all these lines and paste them into your "navcoin.conf" at the end of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 8.</strong> Save and close this file. Restart your Nav Coin Full Node Wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
              If in the future you find that your Wallet is having a low number of connections, replace your addnode lines in the navcoin.conf file with the latest list from the block explorer.

            <h3>Nav Coin Tor Network Setup</h3>
            <p>
              The Nav Coin Full Node Wallet is compatiable with usage through the Tor Network. BitcoinTalk User <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=30">BitcoinFX</a> has configured a series of Tor Nodes for connecting to and sending Nav Coin transactions through the Tor Netowrk.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're unsure what TOR is, please head over to their website to learn all about their great service: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In basic terms, the TOR network is robust method of hiding your IP address from unwanted third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently Nav Coin is secure, but just like any other Crypto Currencies because it is a public network, it is possible for third parties to see which IP addresses are connected at any given time. This does mean users lose an amount of anonymity because with some effort, it could be possible to trace a transaction back to an IP address and potentially infer who owns a wallet, or at least where they were broadcasting from.
            </p>
            <p>
              Connecting your Nav Coin wallet through the TOR network, hides your IP address from the public record and stops this meta data inference from occuring. With this configuration you would be syncing the block chain, sending and receiving coins all through the TOR network rather than over the regular internet.

            <p>
              <strong>Step 1.</strong> Find your NavCoin2 folder in your users %AppData% directory.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Windows</strong> this is usually C:/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/AppData/Roaming/NavCoin2/
                <br />
                (replacing &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your actual computer's username)

              <strong>Step 2.</strong> In this directory create and open a plain text file called "navcoin.conf". If this file already exists, save a copy of it for when you want to switch back to the regular setup and open the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3.</strong> Replace the contents of this file (if any) with the following:
            </p>
            <pre>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 8.</strong> Save and close this file. Restart your Nav Coin Full Node Wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should see your wallet now says "tor" in the bottom right corner, indicating it has picked up this setup.
