                It’s pretty easy to get bank records if you’re a bank, government official or perhaps Mr. Robot; even the Bitcoin can be traced to a simple IP address.
                However, we have created a piece of double encryption sub chain technology that not even a genius can unravel. Are you more than a genius?

                You’ll need to know more than my mother’s maiden name and the name of my fist pet to crack this one.

            <p>We're offering a community raised bounty to anyone who can successfully trace a transaction routed through the NAV anonymous network.
                To be eligible to receive the bounty, we have to be able to reproduce your findings.
