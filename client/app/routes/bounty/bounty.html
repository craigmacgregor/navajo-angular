                It’s pretty easy to get bank records if you’re a bank, government official or perhaps Mr. Robot; even the Bitcoin can be traced to a simple IP address. 
                However, we have created a piece of double encryption sub chain technology that not even a genius can unravel. Are you more than a genius?

                You’ll need to know more than my mother’s maiden name and the name of my fist pet to crack this one.

            <p>We're offering a community raised bounty to anyone who can successfully trace a transaction routed through the NAV anonymous network. 
                To be eligible to receive the bounty, we have to be able to reproduce your findings.
                If you think you've cracked the code, email your results to <a href='mailto:navbounty@gmail.com'>navbounty@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'd like to see the bounty grow and drive interest in NAV then please make a donation to either of the wallets below and share the bounty with your networks.
